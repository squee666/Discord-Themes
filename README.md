## Quality Themes
* ***All **Themes** go into %AppData%\BetterDiscord\themes***
* ***All **Plugins** go into %AppData%\BetterDiscord\plugins***

Note This theme is similar to Monsters Tranquil/Reborn
There is a reason for this I was one of the main maintainers/editers of the V2 version of these themes.

Monster became a maintainer/editer of the V3 version.(which is discontinued officially) 

This results in similar themes but with noticeably different changes as they are maintained seperately and have entirely different code bases.
